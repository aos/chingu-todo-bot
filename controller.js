/**
 * Created by Vampiire on 6/1/17.

 PLAN:

 1) check if a document exists for the given ID (user or channel) - if document exists proceed to 2)

 1a) if document does not yet exist create it for that given user or channel ID

 2)
 add: add a [list item] to that document's list array
 complete: find item based on its id [item.id] and edit item.completed to True and add a timestamp
 view: iterate through the documents in the collection and display each
 delete: find the item based on its id [item.id] and splice it out of the list array

 3) after each add / delete / done is complete callback view
