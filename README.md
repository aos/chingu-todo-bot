# Super ToDo Bot

Super ToDoBot is here to help you remember!

This is a lightweight bot that can handle private lists for each user of your team.
It can be added team wide or in specific channels.

There are two slash commands used for this bot.

To add an item:
    `/todo add <item>`

To view your list:
    `/todo view`

Using the two dropdown menus under your list you can quickly complete or delete items. The display will automatically update to reflect these changes.

When you complete an item it's display will be updated and a completed timestamp will be added.
When you delete an item it will be removed from the database.

If you have any questions or suggestions submit an issue through Github.
